## Thanks to

Based on the good ***[GDPNope](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gdpnope/kaobbaeanleebomkmkleekoeefldjcpi?hl=es)***.

Lot of sites have made their own system, it's complicated to manage them all. But by auto-refusing most of the majors CSP providers we try to do the most we can. 

I'm working on a solution for sites wich are not using a platform, if you have any ideas, please, submit it. 

Many thanks to:
